TODO / NOTES -> REGARDING NEW OSC CODE:

finally changing OSC the correct way : removing liblo calls altogether, as well as the OscAtoms system, which is redundant
if we are using oscpack (which uses a similar but cleaner system).

ApplicationController's OscMethods SHOULD be oscpack ready, but im not positive (didnt try building yet).

still try to use OscHostAddress and OscContext.

use some code from the OscIoController files.

************IO Methods now are***************
OscController::send(const OutboundPacketStream &stream)
AND
OscController::loMethodHandler(const IpEndpointName &ipEndpoint, const OscReceivedMessage &msg)


when possible, use the iterator interface for OscReceive, instead of the stream interface (use stream for sending only)
-> this also fits in with the majority of MonomeSerial code, which uses list<OscAtom*> or vectors, and therefore iterators.
